><font color=red>This lab requires pre-work that should be completed prior to start of the lab.</font>

> Full completion of this prework is necessary not only to gain basic experience with Azure, but to ensure that the time-consuming "first run" processes happen for your Azure account before the lab and not during the lab. <a href="mailto:openshiftrunsonazure@microsoft.com?Subject=Prework question">Contact us</a> if you have any issues completing pre-work steps.
