= Lab 7: Software Sensor Application

With the connectivity and integration between the AMQ broker and OpenWhisk now complete, the next step is to integrate IoT data using a simulated software sensor.

== Software Sensor

The software sensor is a Spring Boot based application that simulates GPS sensor data for the assets in the factory. It periodically sends location coordinates for each asset similar to how a real GPS sensor works.

Software sensor application is driven by a configuration file located at `iot-serverless-software-sensor/src/main/resources/application.yml`. The configuration file provides current location parameters for each asset.

=== Deploy the Software Sensor

Templates have been created to support the building of a custom image containing the application along with the deployment to OpenShift.

First, instantiate the template to build the image from the root of the project:

[source,bash]
----
 $ cd /home/lab-user/iot-serverless/
 $ oc process -f applier/templates/software-sensor-build.yml | oc apply -f-

 imagestream "software-sensor" created
 buildconfig "software-sensor" created
----

A new BuildConfig and ImageStream will be created along with the triggering of the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/using_images/s2i_images/index.html[Source-to-Image] based build in OpenShift.

A new build should be automatically triggered. Verify the build has started by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
 $  oc get builds -l application=software-sensor

 NAME                TYPE      FROM          STATUS    STARTED              DURATION
software-sensor-1   Source    Git@5896653   Running   About a minute ago
----

When a build is present and running, the logs from the build execution can be seen using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
 $ oc logs -f builds/<build_name>
----

When the image has been built successfully, another template can be instantiated to create the associated DeploymentConfig and Service. A set of parameters must be provided when processing the template including the credentials for access the MQTT broker and the location of the broker within the _iot-serverless_ project.

Execute the following command to instantiate the software sensor deployment template.

[source,bash]
----
 $ oc -p MQTT_USERNAME=iot-serverless -p MQTT_PASSWORD=iot-serverless -p MQTT_APPLICATION_SERVICE=broker-amq-mqtt -p MQTT_TOPIC=proxsensor01 process -f applier/templates/software-sensor-deployment.yml | oc apply -f-

 service "software-sensor" created
 deploymentconfig "software-sensor" created
----

==== Scale up software sensor

By default, the software sensor is configured to have no running pods (specified by a replica count of 0). Execute the following command to enable the software sensor by changing the replica count to 1:

[source,bash]
----
 $ oc scale dc/software-sensor --replicas=1

 deploymentconfig "software-sensor" scaled
----

Verify the software sensor is active by verifying the status using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods -l application=software-sensor

NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
software-sensor-1-jg74d   1/1       Running   0          1m
----

A READY column indicating 1/1 denotes the service is ready and available

This application makes use of link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/application_health.html#container-health-checks-using-probes[OpenShift Health Check] to verify the connectivity of the MongoDB database. Before marking the pod active and healthy, HTTP requests are made on an endpoint exposed on the application supported by link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html[Spring Boot Endpoints]. The source code for this health check can be found at `iot-serverless-software-sensor/src/main/java/com/redhat/iot/MqttHealthIndicator.java`

With the application running, access the software-sensor logs to confirm that it is transmitting data:

[source,bash]
----
 $ oc logs $(oc get pods -l=application=software-sensor -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].metadata.name}')
