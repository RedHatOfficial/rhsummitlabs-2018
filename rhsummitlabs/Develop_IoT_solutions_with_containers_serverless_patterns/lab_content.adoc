== Summary
This lab provides step by step instructions on how to use Serverless architecture for IoT. The lab uses Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and serverless architecture to execute on-demand functions in response to IoT events. Main components of the lab include setting up Apache OpenWhisk, building functions and deploying these functions to OpenWhisk.
