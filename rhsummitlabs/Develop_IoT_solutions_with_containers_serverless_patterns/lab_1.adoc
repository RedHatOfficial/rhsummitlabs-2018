= Lab 1: Deploy OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk can be deployed using the template provided by OpenWhisk on OpenShift project.
Each component of OpenWhisk will be running in its own container.

* Create a new project in OpenShift called _openwhisk_:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc new-project openwhisk --display-name="OpenWhisk"
Now using project "openwhisk" on server "https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

   oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
----

* Deploy OpenWhisk by instantiating the template

[source,bash]
----
$ oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectodd/openwhisk-openshift/master/persistent-template.yml | oc create -f -
----

NOTE: A large number of resources will be created. It will take a few minutes to each of the resources to fully deploy to the OpenWhisk project.

* Use watch command to monitor the progress:

[source,bash]
----
$ watch oc get pods
----

Once all pods are in the “Running” or “Completed state”, hit CTRL+C to break the “watch” command. +

NOTE: Pods may initially report in Error status. This condition should resolve itself in a few moments.

* Check the status of deployment:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pods

* Verify that system is ready by checking if controller recognizes the invoker as healthy:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc logs -f controller-0 | grep "invoker status changed"

[INFO] [#sid_121] [InvokerPool] invoker status changed to 0 -> UnHealthy
[INFO] [#sid_121] [InvokerPool] invoker status changed to 0 -> Healthy
----

OpenWhisk has been successfully deployed when `0 -> Healthy` appears in the log above


== Verify OpenWhisk Deployment using OpenShift web console

* Navigate to the following url in the browser:

link:https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443[https://infranode-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com:8443]

TIP: OpenShift web UI access url is provided in the screen splash when you ssh into the system

* Click on the project name (OpenWhisk) in the upper right corner. A successful deployment will look like the following:

== Configure the OpenWhisk CLI

`wsk` is the CLI to interact with OpenWhisk services which has already been downloaded on this system.  The `wsk` CLI needs to be to be configured to be able to interact with OpenWhisk deployment.

* Use the following commands to configure wsk:

[source,bash]
----
$ AUTH_SECRET=$(oc get secret whisk.auth -o yaml | grep "system:" | awk '{print $2}' | base64 --decode)
$ wsk property set --auth $AUTH_SECRET --apihost $(oc get route/openwhisk --template="{{.spec.host}}")
----

Successful configuration of wsk will show following output:

[source,bash]
----
ok: whisk auth set. Run 'wsk property get --auth' to see the new value.
ok: whisk API host set to openwhisk-openwhisk.apps-<GUID>.generic.opentlc.com
----

IMPORTANT: Use the `-i` option with wsk to avoid the validation error triggered by the self-signed cert in the nginx service.

=== Validate OpenWhisk CLI configuration

* Use the following command validate the `wsk` CLI is operational:

[source,bash]
----
$ wsk -i list
----

A list of entities in the _default_ namespace will be displayed.
